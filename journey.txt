Welcome to my journey of creating a 3DS browser capable of running Discord
First, let me create a roadmap, me 24.03.2023 20:43 
-hello world
-Downloading modern pages
-Creating a super simple dark mode rendering engine html
-simple css...
-Rendering a locally hosted very simple page from my server
-JavaScript interpreter
-Rendering a more complex site, like 3ds.hacks.guide
-Cookies
-Discord? 
-Profit

First, I need a source folder, and a working makefile.
Ill take the makefile from a 3ds-example, noone will care
also i will use 3dslink for testing, so ill set that up as well, and my new 3DS since that one is the only one im not destroying every day.
Next, ill create a simple main.c where I want to draw a hello world with citro2d. Citro2D is supposed to be my rendering shit, hope it works decently, ill take code from my basehaxx_sploit_instlaler for now. 

first done, me 24.03.2023 21:31, simple hello world, will commit now
